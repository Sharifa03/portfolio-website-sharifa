            <p>For "de lieve groene stad" we were tasked with choosing an environmentally
                friendly initiative and making a web-based tour guide for people who already
                live in Amsterdam. We visited Vegan Junk Food Bar and decided to make our app
                about them. A nice restaurant located in De Pijp where you can enjoy plant-based
                foods, which help us all towards a better environment. </p>

            <p>This project focuses on improving reading accessibility for elementary school
                children by transforming the Boekenzoeker platform, developed by the City of
                Amsterdam. The goal is to redesign the platform with engaging and interactive
                elements that cater to a younger audience, making the experience of discovering
                books enjoyable and stimulating for these children.</p>
